# Corona Tracker App
----------------------

[Live Site](https://gunjandhanuka.github.io/corona-tracker-app/)

+ This app was built using *React JS* and tracks the number of infected and recovered people from CoVid-19 and also the deaths caused by it.
+ The app has live *Line Chart* for the global stats and *Bar Charts* for each country.
+ The Chart has been made using *Chart js-2*.
+ The Cards use the *Material-UI* library.
+ The Country Name Selector uses the *Material-UI Selector*.

**The API used: [covid19.mathdro.id/api/].**

This was my first project on React and I learnt using the JavaScript Mastery Channel on YouTube. Huge thanks to him.
